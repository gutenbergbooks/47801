<p class="drop-cap">THE well-known spice ginger is
the underground stem (<i>rhizome</i>)
of an herbaceous reed-like plant
known as <i>Zingiber officinale</i>.
The rhizome is perennial, but the leaf
and flower-bearing stems are annual.
The stems are from three to six feet
high. The leaves of the upper part of
the stem are sword-shaped; the lower
leaves are rudimentary and sheath-like.
The flowers occur in the form of
conical spikes borne upon the apex of
stems which bear only sheath-like
leaves.</p>

<p>The ginger plant is said to be a native
of southern Asia, although it is
now rarely found growing wild. It is
very extensively cultivated in the
tropical countries of both hemispheres,
particularly in southern China, India,
Africa, and Jamaica. The word ginger
is said to have been derived from the
Greek "Zingiber," which again was derived
from the Arabian "Zindschabil,"
which means the "root from India."
It is further stated that the word was
derived from Gingi, a country west of
Pondecheri where the plant is said to
grow wild.</p>

<p>True ginger must not be confounded
with "wild ginger," which is a small
herbaceous plant (<i>Asarum canadense</i>)
of the United States. The long, slender
rhizomes of <i>Asarum</i> have a pungent,
aromatic taste similar to ginger. According
to popular belief this plant
has a peculiar charm. Friends provided
with the leaves are enabled to
converse with each other, though many
miles apart and speaking in the faintest
whisper.</p>

<p>The early Greeks and Romans made
extensive use of ginger as a spice and
as a medicine. During the third century
it was apparently a very costly
spice, but during the eleventh century
it became cheaper, owing to extensive
cultivation, and was quite generally
used in Europe. Dioscrides and Plinius
maintained that this spice was
derived chiefly from Arabia. The
noted traveler and historian, Marco
Polo (1280-1290) is said to have been
the first European who saw the wild-growing
plant in its home in India.
As early as the thirteenth century a
considerable number of varieties of
ginger were under cultivation, which
received distinctive names as Beledi,
Colombino, Gebeli, Deli, etc., usually
named after the country or locality
from which it was obtained.</p>

<p>At the present time Jamaica supplies
the United States with nearly all of
the ginger, and this island is, therefore,
known as "the land of ginger."
Cochin-China and Africa also yield
much ginger. In Jamaica the process
of cultivation is somewhat as follows:
During March and April portions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
rhizomes, each bearing an "eye" (bud),
are placed in furrows about one foot
apart and covered with a few inches of
soil. The lazy planter leaves portions
of the rhizomes in the soil from year
to year so as to avoid the necessity of
planting, such ginger being known as
"ratoon ginger" in contradistinction to
the "plant ginger." The planted ginger
soon sprouts, sending up shoots
which require much sunlight and rain,
both of which are plentiful in Jamaica.
The field should be kept free from
weeds which is not generally done for
several reasons. In the first place
pulling the weeds is apt to loosen the
soil about the rhizomes which induces
the development of "ginger rot," perhaps
due to a fungus. Secondly, the
Jamaica ginger planter is naturally
lazy and does not like to exert himself.
The careful planter burns the
soil over before planting so as to destroy
the seeds of weeds. In brief it
may be stated that ginger is planted,
tended, and gathered much as potatoes
are in the United States. As
soon as gathered the rhizomes are
freed from dirt, roots, and branches
and thrown into a vessel of water preparatory
to peeling. Peeling consists
in removing the outer coat by means
of a narrow-bladed knife. As soon as
peeled the rhizomes are again thrown
into water and washed. The object of
keeping the "roots" in water and washing
them frequently is to produce a
white article. To this end bleaching by
means of burning sulphur and chlorine
fumes has been resorted to. Some
ginger, especially that of Jamaica, is
dusted over with powdered lime; this
colors the ginger white very effectively.
The bleaching processes also serve to
destroy parasites which may infest the
ginger before it is thoroughly dried.</p>

<p>The drying or curing of ginger is
done in the sun. A piece of ground is
leveled and laid with stone and cement.
Upon this the rhizomes are spread
from day to day for from six to eight
days. At night and during rains they
are placed under cover. The small
planter does the curing upon mats of
sticks, boards, palm or banana leaves
raised somewhat above the ground.
Very frequently the drying is done
upon leaves placed directly upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Not by any means all the ginger
upon the market is peeled. The
Jamaica ginger usually is; the African
ginger is usually unpeeled, and hence
dark in color; the Chinese ginger is
usually partially peeled. Peeling
makes the product appear whiter and
hastens drying very materially, but
much of the ethereal oil and active
principle is thereby lost since it occurs
most plentifully in the outer coat.</p>

<p>The ginger crop impoverishes the
soil very rapidly; every few years a
new field must be planted. Forest soil
is said to yield the best crops and in
Jamaica thousands of acres of forest
are annually destroyed by fire to prepare
new ginger fields. Ginger appears
upon the market either whole or
ground. Unfortunately the ground article
is oftentimes adulterated; for instance,
with sago, tapioca, potato,
wheat, and rice starch, with cayenne
pepper, mustard, and other substances.</p>

<p>Ginger has been an important commercial
and household article ever
since the first century of our era.
Poets and prose writers of the past and
present have praised ginger and the
many preparations having ginger in
composition, because of their
aromatic pungent taste and stimulating
effect. The opening quotation from
Shakespeare indicates the properties
of ginger. That it was a highly-valued
spice during the time of Mandeville
(1300-1372) is evident from a quotation
from his "travels."</p>

<p>"Be alle that contree growe the gode
gyngevere (ginger), and therefore
thidre gon the Marchauntes for Spicerye."</p>

<p>Green ginger pickled in sugar was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
highly prized during the middle ages.
There are a number of beverages which
contain ginger. Gingerade is water
charged with carbonic acid gas and
flavored with ginger, being almost
identical with ginger-pop. Ginger-beer
is prepared by fermenting cream-of-tartar,
ginger, and sugar with yeast
and water. Ginger-ale is supposed to
be identical with ginger-beer. These
ginger drinks are all refreshing, but I
believe my readers will agree that
there is usually too much ginger present;
the hot, burning sensation in the
mouth is not very pleasant. It may
be that the trouble lies in taking too
much of the drink at a time.</p>

<p>In my estimation ginger as used by
the baker is most appreciated and here
again I believe my readers will agree
with me. Who has not heard of ginger-bread?
This sweet cake flavored
with ginger is not by any means of recent
origin. The great English bard
Chaucer sang its praises long ago
(1328-1400):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"They fette him first the sweete wyn,</div>
    <div class="verse">And mede eek in a maselyn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-1_5">And roial spicerye</div>
    <div class="verse">Of <i>ginge breed</i> that was full fyn."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare also must have valued
this bread very highly, for in the play,
"Love's Labor Lost," he says:</p>

<p>"An I had but one penny in the
world thou shouldst have it to buy
<i>ginger-bread</i>."</p>

<p>Ginger-bread is often made into fanciful
shapes. Cats, dogs, horses, elephants
and men are cut out of the
rolled dough and then baked. Many
of my readers are perhaps familiar
with some of the beautiful playtime
songs of Alice Riley and Jessie Gaynor.
The following are the words of
one of these songs, entitled, "The
Ginger-bread Man." It describes the
ginger-bread man very beautifully in
the first verse. His awful fate, evidently
in the hands of a small cannibal, is very
graphically described in the second
verse. I regret being wholly unable
to supply the music. Here are the
words by Alice Riley:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Oh the ginger-bread man, the ginger-bread man,</div>
	  <div class="verse">The round little, brown little ginger-bread man,</div>
	  <div class="verse">He has sugary eyes and a sugary nose,</div>
	  <div class="verse">And he's sweet from his crown to his sugary toes,</div>
	  <div class="verse">Is this dear little, queer little ginger-bread man,</div>
	  <div class="verse">This dear little ginger-bread man.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
	  <div class="verse">"Oh the ginger-bread man, the ginger-bread man,</div>
	  <div class="verse">The poor little, sad little ginger-bread man,</div>
	  <div class="verse">For he lost his poor arms, and he lost both his feet,</div>
	  <div class="verse">And he lost his poor head, it was so good to eat,</div>
	  <div class="verse">And his vest buttons tasted uncommonly sweet,</div>
	  <div class="verse">Ah, poor little ginger-bread man."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Gingersnaps are very much liked by
many. I used to demolish them by
the pound until someone whispered in
my ear that "bad eggs were used in
making them." Since then my appetite
for gingersnaps has lessened. I
hope what that man said is not true.
Gingernut is another cake containing
ginger and sweetened with molasses.</p>

<p>At the present time ginger is not
very extensively used as a medicine.
The powder or tincture is effective in
some forms of indigestion. It is used
to correct a bad breath, in tooth-ache,
as a gargle and mouth-wash, in colic,
and in dysentery. In a German work
on pharmacy I find that it is recommended
in catarrh of the stomach and
for "Katzenjammer." It will not be
necessary to explain Katzenjammer

<p class="drop-cap">IN order to understand this subject
we must first ascertain the conditions
under which sap is first produced,
what it is, and how it circulates.</p>

<p>To do this we must first know something
of the structure of those parts of
the tree which serve as channels, or
ducts, and those other parts which
gather the sap and dispose of the waste
after it has completed its mission.</p>

<p>To begin with, the tree is composed
of small structures, too small for the
naked eye to distinguish. Each structure
is, at least for a time, a whole in
itself, containing solid, semi-solid, and
fluid parts which differ in their chemical
nature. These structures are the cells,
and when a large number of them are
united in close contact they form a cellular
tissue through which the sap
passes from the roots to the leaves, and
from the leaves to the growing parts
of the young tree, or shoot.</p>

<p>This cellular tissue is superseded by
another tissue which is much stronger
and which takes up the work of the
cellular tissue, when the tree becomes
too large to be supported by the weaker
form. It is more solidly formed and is
composed of elongated cells which are
joined together in a series with their
ends overlapping. This is known as
woody fiber. The cellular tissue now
exists in the tree stem only in the pith,
and in the medullary rays which we
see in the grain of any hard wood,
radiating from the pith.</p>

<p>With the statement, then, that these
tissues form the timber, and that the
bark and roots only present a modification
of the same structures, we will
pass to the tree as we see it with the
naked eye.</p>

<p>If we saw the trunk of a tree, of any
considerable size, squarely in two, we
find three forms which differ in solidity,
rigidity, and appearance; namely, the
heart-wood, sap-wood, and bark. The
heart-wood is the firm, solid wood surrounding
the center of the tree, the
sap-wood is the softer wood outside
the heart-wood, while the bark forms
the skin or outer covering for the
whole.</p>

<p>Trees grow from the center outward,
hence the present sap-wood will in
time become heart-wood and be covered
by a new layer of sap-wood, and
the present heart-wood is simply sap-wood
which has become solidified by
the deposit within its tissues of resinous
and other matter secreted by the
tree. It is now useless for sap-carrying
purposes and seems to exercise only
the function of supporting the tree in
its position. It is through the outer,
younger layer or sap-wood that the
sap ascends.</p>

<p>Now, if we examine the end of our
stick more closely we see a series of
rings, clearly marked, circling from
the center of the tree and ranging in
size from the tiny one which encloses
the pith, to the large one which forms
the outer surface next to the bark.
They are caused by a constant annual
deposit and outward growth, by which
a layer is added to the outer surface of
the sap-wood each season. Hence, by
counting these we may determine the
age of the tree. Less distinct rings
may appear but they will not deceive
us as we know that they are caused by
a cessation of growth, which may have
been caused by drouth.</p>

<p>As a general rule these rings are
more distinct in trees inhabiting a
climate where vegetation is entirely
suspended by the cold after each layer
is formed. In warmer regions they are
not so distinct. This is especially
interesting when we study fossils of
trees which in many cases show a
great difference in climatic conditions
in the early ages from those we have
at the present time.</p>

<p>The layers of bark are much thinner
than those of the wood and are not so
readily distinguished. They are formed
from the interior so that the oldest are
on the outside. The older ones fall
off, however, so that we cannot trace
as many rings in the bark as we can in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the wood, although one is formed in
each for every season that the tree
lives.</p>

<p>The roots of the tree spread out underground
and are the agents through
which the tree derives most of the
moisture so necessary to its growth.
They absorb moisture only at their
extremities and usually spread to just
such an extent that the water which
falls off the outer branches of a tree
during a rain, falls exactly where the
tender rootlets can gather it up at
once and hurry it back up the trunk
of the tree. In ground that is springy,
or naturally moist, the roots do not
depend so much on the rainfall but
reach out after moisture wherever it
exists in the soil.</p>

<p>Spring seems to give a new impulse
to life, especially to vegetable life,
which always responds promptly to the
genial rays of the sun. During the
winter, in our climate, the cells which
form our trees are contracted by the
cold and when the warm days cause
them to resume their natural size, a
small vacuum is formed in each cell,
which the first warm days proceed to
enlarge by thawing only the trunk and
branches of the tree, leaving the roots
below embedded in frozen soil from
which but little moisture can be drawn,
while evaporation draws moisture from
the trunk and branches with irresistible
force. A warm rain now comes, thaws
out the soil, and sets the juices therein
contained in motion. An immediate
rush of sap up the trunk of the tree is
the result. It clears out the pores or
channels, as a spring freshet clears
out the water courses, it rushes into
the branches, and the branches rejoice
and put on their livery of
green; it rushes out through the porous
surface of the limbs and rises in
the air in the form of vapor, while that
which does not escape becomes charged
with life and returns down a devious
pathway and lays the foundation for
another season's growth.</p>

<p>But why should the sap ascend the
tree?</p>

<p>This is only one of many questions
that the tree will not answer and no
one else ever has answered. If we take
a strip of blotting-paper and insert one
end of it in an ink-well, the ink immediately
begins to climb up the blotting-paper
by means of the force known as
capillary attraction. Here, says the
seeker for truth, is the reason for the
ascent of sap, and many profound authors
have agreed that he is right.
Others claim, however, that he is
wrong, while still others think he is
only partly wrong and that this force
has something to do with it. If we cut
the roots from a tree and insert the
stem in water we will soon find that
this force is not the sole cause for the
ascent of sap. Another student has
made experiments with the force called
diffusion, and claims that this explains
the rise of sap to such remarkable
heights; but diffusion does not work
fast enough and hence must be thrown
aside. Another finds that water is imbibed
through fine porous substances
with great force and that air can thus
be compressed to several atmospheres,
and this force is affirmed to be the
one at work in our trees. But the fact
that the amputation of the leaves and
branches checks the ascent is brought
forward and this theory falls to the
ground. The fact that liquid films
have a tendency to expand rapidly on
wetable surfaces was next advanced,
but the objection to the first theory
met it at once.</p>

<p>Another interesting theory is now
brought forward and has the advantage
of practical demonstration, that is, an
artificial model was made through
which water ascended. It is based on
the principle that water will pass
through moist films that air will not
penetrate, on the fact that evaporation
takes place under right conditions
with force enough to cause something
of a vacuum, and also on the elasticity
of the cells.</p>

<p>The model was constructed of glass
tubes, closed at one end with a piece of
bladder, and joined together in series
by means of thick-walled caoutchouc
tubing; the top which represented a
leaf was a funnel closed by a bladder.
This artificial cell chain was filled with
water, mixed with carbolic acid to
keep the pores from clogging, and was
set up with its base immersed. The
fluid evaporated through the membrane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
at the top of the funnel, which drew
up more from the cells below, the space
so caused being continually filled from
the base. This is an interesting experiment
and is said to solve the question,
but it is open to the same objection,
that a tree will not absorb fluid and
carry it for any length of time after
the roots are cut off. I regard it, however
as a long stride in the right direction.</p>

<p>To what source, then, must we look
for an explanation of this process?</p>

<p>I think it is a fact that the small, new
root-fibers imbibe fluid with considerable
force, but it is undoubtedly a fact
that they soon lose this force when deprived
of the leaves; that the leaves
with the aid of evaporation, exert a
great force, which the above experiment
plainly indicates; and I cannot
consistently dismiss the idea that capillary
attraction has something to do
with it. If we also add to this the theory
that the swaying of the stems and
branches by the wind is continually
changing the shape and size of the
cells and is thus driving the juices
wherever an opening will allow them
to travel, thus bringing the elasticity
of the tree to our aid, we have again
advanced.</p>

<p>But the principle of life is not discovered.
Whenever it is we may find it
to be a force much greater than any
we have so far examined, and which
may even cause the overthrow of all
theories heretofore advanced.</p>

  EMERSON AND THE WOODPECKER STORY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_n.jpg" width="56" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">NO squirrel works harder at his
pine-nut harvest than the carpenter
woodpeckers in autumn
at their acorn harvest, says John
Muir in the December <i>Atlantic</i>, drilling
holes in the thick, corky bark of the
yellow pine and incense cedar, in which
to store the crop for winter use; a hole
for each acorn so nicely adjusted as to
size that when the acorn, point fore-most,
is driven in, it fits so well that it
cannot be drawn out without digging
around it. Each acorn is thus carefully
stored in a dry bin, perfectly protected
from the weather, a most laborious
method of stowing away a crop, a granary
for each kernel. Yet they never
seem to weary at the work, but go on
so diligently they seem determined that
every acorn in the grove shall be saved.
They are never seen eating acorns at
the time they are storing them, and it
is commonly believed that they never
eat them or intend to eat them, but that
the wise birds store them and protect
them solely for the sake of the worms
they are supposed to contain. And because
these worms are too small for use
at the time the acorns drop, they are
shut up like lean calves and steers, each
in a separate stall, with abundance of
food to grow big and fat by the time
they will be the most wanted, that is, in
winter, when insects are scarce and
stall-fed worms most valuable. So
these woodpeckers are supposed to be
a sort of cattle-raiser, each with a
drove of thousands, rivaling the ants
that raise grain and keep herds of
plant lice for milk cows. Needless to
say, the story is not true, though some
naturalists even believe it. When Emerson
was in the park, having heard the
worm story, and seen the great pines
plugged full of acorns, he asked (just
to pump me, I suppose): "Why do
woodpeckers take the trouble to put
acorns into the bark of the trees?"
"For the same reason," I replied, "that
bees store honey and squirrels nuts."
"But they tell me, Mr. Muir, that woodpeckers
don't eat acorns." "Yes they
do," I said. "I have seen them eating
them. During snowstorms they seem
to eat little besides acorns. I have repeatedly
interrupted them at their
meals, and seen the perfectly sound,
half-eaten acorns. They eat them in
the shell as some people eat eggs."
"But what about the worms?" "I suppose,"
I said, "that when they come to
a wormy one they eat both worm and
acorn. Anyhow, they eat the sound
ones when they can't find anything they
like better, and from the time they
store them until they are used they
guard them, and woe to the squirrel or
jay caught stealing."</p>

  THE CRAB-EATING OPOSSUM.</h2>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE crab-eating opossum (<i>Philander
philander</i>) is one of the
largest of the family. The
body is nine and one-half
inches long, and the tail nearly thirteen
inches. It has a wide range, extending
throughout all of tropical America. It
is numerous in the woods of Brazil,
preferring the proximity of swamps,
which furnish it with crabs. It lives
almost exclusively in trees, and descends
to the ground only when it
wishes to forage.</p>

<p>While it proceeds slowly and awkwardly
on the ground, its prehensile
tail enables it to climb trees with some
facility. This opossum readily entraps
smaller mammals, reptiles, and insects,
and especially crabs, which are its
favorite food. It preys upon birds and
their nests, but it also eats fruit, and is
said to visit poultry yards and to cause
great devastation among chickens and
pigeons.</p>

<p>The young of the crab-eating opossum
differ in color from the old animals.
They are completely naked at
birth, but when they are sufficiently developed
to leave the pouch, they grow
a short, silky fur of a shining nut-brown
color, which gradually deepens
into the dark brownish-black color of
maturity. All observers agree that the
little creatures escape from the pouch
and, moving around and upon the
mother's body, afford a charming spectacle.
The pouch is formed by two
folds of skin, which are laid over the
unformed young attached to the mammae.</p>

<p>The opossum is extensively hunted
on account of the havoc it works among
poultry.</p>

<p>The negroes are its enemies, and kill
it whenever and wherever they can.
The flesh is said to be unpalatable to
most white persons, for two glands
impart a very strong and repellent odor
of garlic to it, but the negroes like it,
and the flesh repays them for the
trouble of the pursuit. The opossum,
however, is not easily killed, and resorts
to dissimulation when hard
pressed, rolls up like a ball, and feigns
to be dead. To anyone not acquainted
with its habits, the open jaws, the extended
tongue, the dimmed eyes would
be ample confirmation of it, but the
experienced observer knows that it is
only "'possuming," and that as soon
as the enemy withdraws it will gradually
get on its legs and make for the
woods.</p>

<p>It is said that the opossum was formerly
found in Europe, but now only
inhabits America. Nearly all of the
species live in the forest or in the underbrush,
making their homes in hollow
trees, holes in the ground, among
thick grass and in bushes. All are
nocturnal in their habits and lead a
solitary, roving life. The opossum
lives with its mate only during the
pairing time. It has no fixed habitation.
In captivity it is the least interesting
of animals. Rolled up and motionless,
it lies all day, and only when
provoked does it make the slightest
movement. It opens its mouth as wide
as possible, and for as long a time as
one stands before it, as if it suffered
from lockjaw.</p>

<p>The opossum can hardly be classed
among the game animals of America,
yet its pursuit in the South in old plantation
days used to afford the staple
amusement for the dusky toilers of the
cotton states. It was the custom, as
often as the late fall days brought with
them the ripened fruit and golden
grain, for the dark population of the
plantation, sometimes accompanied by
young "massa," to have a grand 'possum
hunt <i>a la mode</i>. We would describe
the method of taking it, were it
the policy of this magazine to show approval
of a most cruel practice. Happily
the custom, through change of
circumstances, has fallen into disuse.</p>

<p>The specimen of this interesting
animal which we present in this number
of <span class="sc">Birds and All Nature</span> was
captured, with its mother and five
young ones, in a car load of bananas,
having traveled all the way from the
tropics to Chicago in a crate of the
fruit. The mother and young were
kept alive by eating the bananas, another
proof that the crab-eating opossum
does not feed exclusively upon
animal food.</p>

<h2><a name="WASHINGTON_AND_LINCOLN" id="WASHINGTON_AND_LINCOLN"></a>
  WASHINGTON AND LINCOLN.</h2>

<p class="ac smaller">EMILY C. THOMPSON.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="24" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT is natural that at this time our
thoughts should turn toward two
of our great national heroes. This
month is to us not merely the
month of February, marking one of
the twelve divisions of our calendar
year, but it is a continuous memorial
of two of our revered statesmen. We
read all we can about our glorified dead,
we search the words spoken by them,
we visit the places where they toiled
for us, and we scan even their homes
trying to form a picture of their lives.
We do even more. We presume to
imagine their thoughts and conjure up
the very ideas which might have occurred
to them as they stood in these
spots now hallowed by memories of
them.</p>

<p>It is a fascinating occupation to
fathom the characters of truly great
men and contemplate their attitude
toward various subjects. Sometimes
mere conjectures are the fruit of our
toil. At other times sure conclusions
are reached from facts which are
brought to light. Stories galore are
told of both Lincoln and Washington,
which help us more vividly to picture
their natures. The question in which
we are interested could easily be answered
if we knew these men, but still
as we are acquainted with the manifestations
of their characteristics we
can answer it almost as satisfactorily.
Did Lincoln and Washington love
nature? Could they appreciate her
beauties, and did they evince an interest
in her creations?</p>

<p>Lincoln in his log-cabin home, splitting
rails, working on the farm, hunting
coons, driving the horses and cattle,
must have found a glorious opportunity
to become acquainted with this great
mother of ours. The son of a pioneer
who, with his great covered wagon, cattle,
family, and household belongings,
wanders over the country, whose only
neighbors for hundreds of miles are the
birds in the woods, the rabbits in the
field, and the fish in the stream, the son
of such a man certainly sees nature as
few of our city-bred, World's Fair,
Paris Exposition young people, can
imagine it. Lincoln was content with
these, his neighbors. Never do we
hear sighs from him and wishes that his
lot might be exchanged for that of another,
even if his lot was toilsome and
lonely. Who can tell but he thus imbibed
his love for pure freedom undefiled
and his lofty conceptions of this
life in its relation to this world and
something beyond?</p>

<p>We cannot doubt that the great, tall,
clumsy lad had a real love in his heart
for the little feathered and furry friends
about him, and not simply a love for
the beautiful ones, but what is far
higher a feeling of sympathy even for
the ugly and a genuine tender solicitude
for all.</p>

<p>Even when the youth became a man
perplexed by business and political
problems his nature remained unaltered.
Once when a party of his friends on a
judicial circuit stopped to water their
horses, Lincoln was not there. His
companion on the way was asked of
his whereabouts. He replied that the
last he had seen of Lincoln he was hunting
around for a bird's nest, two of the
former occupants of which he held in
his hand. The wind had blown the
tiny nestlings from their snug little
home and the greathearted man was
trying to find the nest for the wee, helpless
chirpers. The same great heart
which felt the human cry of pain as
keenly as the bewildered cry of the
little birds gave its last throb to restore
little black nestlings to the warm comfort
of free homes protected by law.</p>

<p>There is an amusing incident, told
probably as a "good one" upon the
politician, but which has more than
an amusing side to us. Lincoln was
one of a party of ladies and gentlemen,
dressed in their best, journeying along
a country road. Their attention was
arrested by the distressed squealings
of a pig. There it was by the roadside,
caught in a fence. Of course a general
laugh followed. To the astonishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of all Lincoln, clad as he was, dismounted
from his horse and released
the poor animal. He could not see
even an occupant of the pigsty suffer
without feelings of sympathy.</p>

<p>We expect different stories of Washington,
a different attitude toward
nature and animals, just as the nature
of the man was different. Visit Mt.
Vernon and at once you feel his relation
to the natural world, a love and
keen appreciation of the beautiful in
nature, with a thorough conviction that
where man tampers with the rough
beauties of nature a severe orderliness,
precision, and care must be manifested.</p>

<p>Seated upon his front veranda, Washington
beheld every day a scene of
beauty, one gaze at which stays with a
stranger for months and for years.
The green of his own lawn ending
abruptly not far away with the decline
of the bluff, the tops of a few trees
farther down just visible, and the blue
waters of the Potomac bounded in the
distance by the bluff of the opposite
bank; to the right a carefully mowed
lawn sloping away in natural terraces
to the bank of the river; to the left a
small sward and orchard; behind the
house a large green plot. It is to the
left of the beautiful, sunny, open space
behind the house that the garden is
found. Every visitor must spend a
few moments there, admiring the
hedges, the neatly-trimmed boxtrees,
the regular formal designs, and incidentally
bidding "Good-day" to the
saucy little squirrel who scampers about
the paths. It is an interesting spot as
revealing what Washington considered
the beauty of scenic gardening.</p>

<p>Washington is said to have loved noble
horses and to have taken great pride in
his stables. He always drove white
horses with hoofs painted black. Of
dogs, too, he was exceedingly fond and
kept an accurate account of the pedigree
of every animal belonging to the
estate. Usually he drove in a carriage
drawn by a span while his family
came next in a larger vehicle drawn by
four horses. On state occasions he
allowed himself the luxury of an elegant
coach and six.</p>

<p>Varied are the feelings with which
one views the estate of our first president.
It is almost impossible in the
midst of all this beauty to realize that
it was the same man who enjoyed this
peaceful home of luxury and spent that
awful winter at Valley Forge or crossed
the Delaware amid the floating ice.
The quiet restfulness of Mt. Vernon
must have been a haven of peace to
the valiant soldier who faced the enemy
so bravely, to the statesman who
toiled so assiduously for his country,
and to the heart of human sympathy
returning even from the cities of 1776.</p>

<p>At the foot of a gentle slope about
midway between the house and the
boat-landing is the tomb of the Washington
family. The very aged, gray
resting-place has been exchanged for
one of more modern design. An open
vault in front with a protection of iron
grating and other chambers extending
into the earth form the tomb. It is
with awe that the visitor approaches
the open vault to gaze upon the gray
sarcophagi of George and Martha Washington
standing out in bold relief
against the dark gray walls and background.
Few are the letters sculptured
upon the stone caskets, but above in
the wall behind them is a square slab
bearing the words: "I am the resurrection
and the life; he that believeth
on me shall not perish but have everlasting
life."</p>

<p>It is touching to see the tributes
which have been paid to this great
man, the trees planted in his honor,
the monuments erected to his memory,
but none is more touching than the unconscious
tribute which nature herself
is giving. The tomb is silent and cold.
One thinks of the sterner qualities of
the dead, when a bit of color catches
the eye. There above the sarcophagi
in a corner of the inscribed tablet nestle
two little yellow birds, a fitting
tribute of Mother Nature to her love
and trustfulness in one of her noblest
sons.</p>

<p>England holds the honor of having
first formed societies for the prevention
of cruelty to animals and of having first
legislated for its punishment.</p>

  THE GEOGRAPHIC TURTLE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_m.jpg" width="70" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">MAP and mud-turtle (<i>Malacoclemmys
geographicus</i>) are the
more common names by which
this animal is known; and as it
is a characteristic species of the waters
of Illinois and occurs in countless numbers
in lakes, rivers, and flood-ground
pools, it may be assumed that most of
our readers have met with it. It is
exceedingly common in the Illinois
and Mississippi rivers, where it is often
confounded with quite another species.
It is the only species seen by Mr. F.
M. Woodruff on the shores of Lake
Michigan, whence he has frequently
chased it to the water and caught it in
his hands. It is timid and inoffensive
in disposition, always sliding from
bank or log when approached, and
even when captured shows none of the
ferocity of the snapper. The great
strength of its jaws, unsurpassed in
massiveness by any of our turtles,
would enable it to inflict serious
wounds, and it is not a little surprising
to find such efficient weapons of offense
unaccompanied by special ruggedness
of temper. Our streams and lakes,
with their numerous sandy shores, and
their abundance of animal and vegetable
life, would seem to form an ideal habitat
for these reptiles. Their food consists
ordinarily of fishes, frogs, and
mollusks, crayfishes, aquatic insects,
and vegetation. They trouble fishermen
at times by devouring fishes which
they have caught on trot-lines or in
set nets. They are not rapid swimmers.
An animal once within reach of
their jaws must be very quick to escape
capture. The eggs are white and are
provided with a rather tough shell.
They bury their eggs in sand on the
shore and leave them to hatch by the
sun's heat.</p>

<p>A gentleman who had a pet turtle
which he kept in a tank tells some interesting
things about its appetite.
During the early spring he fed him on
bits of meat, either raw or cooked.
Having no teeth, he swallowed these
whole, gulping them down with large
quantities of water. Outside of his
tank he would carry food in his mouth
for hours at a time, but apparently
was unable to swallow it with his
head out of water. He always aimed
well, and snapped up bits of meat as
carefully and as quickly as if they had
been bits of life that might escape him.
When a morsel was too large to be
swallowed whole, he held it down firmly
with his fore feet and pulled bits off
with his mouth. His owner once gave
him a fish so large that it took him three
hours to eat it, and in all that time he
never removed his foot. Rival turtles
and swift currents had probably taught
him this bit of discretion in the days
of his freedom. One time he put
twenty small fish averaging three
inches in length into his tank, thinking
this would be a treat for him and
would save the trouble of feeding him
for some time. A treat he evidently
considered it, for within half an hour
he had disposed of the entire lot.
This excited the admiration of the
gentleman's boy friends, and the next
day they brought in sixty small fish.
At the end of the second day the
turtle looked about with an Oliver
Twist-like air, which plainly called for
more. When there was any perceptible
difference in the size of the fish it
always ate the largest one first. It ate
grasshoppers and dragon-flies, tadpoles,
and little frogs&mdash;animal food of any
kind. It would eat eggs as readily as
meat. This voracity of appetite accounts
for much of the destruction of
young fish life in our lakes and streams,
where these turtles are extremely
abundant.</p>

<p>In the Philippines, it is said, there
lives a turtle that climbs trees. The
feet are strongly webbed, and each has
three sharp claws.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Rev. Sam Jones says of a
trained bird dog that he once
saw in the tall grass jumping
up to get signals from his master's
hand, moving to the right or left,
or lying down without a word spoken:
"When I saw the faithfulness of that
animal in carrying out the wishes of
its human master I was ashamed of
myself in the presence of the dog."</p>

<p>A hunting dog is busy with eye and
ear. Every nerve seems strained to
catch the slightest indication of game.
But those who know the dog best
know he is mainly occupied with his
nose. That delicate organ dilates and
adjusts itself constantly to every breath
of air.</p>

<p>The bird dog knows of the presence
of a game bird before he can see it.
He scents its location at long range.
He is trained to "stand" when he
recognizes the scent. With one paw
lifted, his nose and tail stretched out
to their greatest reach, he points his
master to the spot where the game is
to be found. At the word of command
he moves cautiously forward towards
the bird, and when his master is ready
another word causes the dog to "flush"
the bird, or make it take wing.</p>

<p>The hound upon the track of fox or
deer has remarkable power, not only
of following the exact track made by
the pursued animal, even when some
hours have elapsed since the game
passed that way, but his scent is so
keen that in many instances he is able
to tell, when he comes upon such a
track, which way the deer or fox was
running. Sometimes the hound "takes
the back track," but the best dogs are
usually so positive in this sense that
they make no mistakes as to which
way the animal has traveled.</p>

<p>It is common knowledge, but none
the less marvelous, that an ordinary
dog is usually able to follow his master
by scent alone through the crowded
streets of the city or across fields
where a thousand fragrant flowers and
grasses seem to arise on purpose to
baffle him.</p>

<p>This marvelous power is not confined
to dogs. Many other animals
possess it in a remarkable degree. The
keenness of this sense in deer, antelopes,
and other wild ruminants is so
well known that hunters despair of
ever approaching them except from
the side which gives them the wind in
their faces so that their own peculiar
scent may be carried away from the
extremely sensitive nostrils of their
game. The hippopotamus has this
sense highly developed and can discover
his human enemy without getting
sight of him or hearing his approach.</p>

<p>The polar bear climbs upon an iceberg
and sniffs afar the dead whale
floating his way, although still miles
toward the horizon. The camel in the
desert is often saved from death by the
keenness and accuracy of his olfactory
organs, which tell him the direction he
must take to fill his depleted reservoir
with water.</p>

<p>The North American Indian smells
as keenly as he sees, for he can not
only detect the presence of human beings
by his nose alone, but also surely
tell whether they are of his own or the
suspected white race. In the Massachusetts
Asylum for the Blind was a
mute girl named Julia Brace, who
knew her friends and acquaintances by
the peculiar odors of their hands. Not
being able to see them or converse
with them, she was compelled to distinguish
them by the sense of
smell alone. So remarkable were her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
powers that she was regularly employed
in assorting the clothes of the pupils
as they came from the wash, that operation
not being far-reaching enough
to remove the signs which were known
to her alone. The case of James
Mitchell, who was deaf and blind from
his birth, is remarkable, for he could
detect the approach of a stranger in
this way.</p>

<p>Those who have made a thorough
study of the subject claim that there
is a peculiar odor belonging to every
class of living beings, and each is subdivided
so that each order, family,
species, race, and variety is distinct.
Furthermore every individual is distinct
from the rest of his kind in the
odor given off so profusely and unconsciously
in most instances.</p>

<p>Horses seem to be somewhat less
keen than dogs in noting odors, for a
horse which is accustomed to but one
groom and will not consent to attendance
from another may sometimes be
deceived by having the new groom
dress himself in the clothes of his
predecessor.</p>

<p>Insects possess this sense to such a
degree that flies have been the means
of locating a dead rat under a floor by
their settling over the body in large
numbers, although there was no chance
for them to reach it. Just where the
organs of smell are in insects has been
disputed among scientists. Sir John
Lubbock is inclined to the opinion
that they are located in the antennæ
and palpi, though some contend that
insects smell as the air is taken in at
the spiracles or breathing-holes which
are scattered over their bodies.</p>

<p>That fish have this sense to some
extent is attested by fishermen who
use essential oils upon their bait and
secure readier attention from the inhabitants
of the water. But fish seem
to be less capable of smell than even
the reptiles upon land who are not
considered at all remarkable in this
respect. To make up in some sort for
this deficiency there are some kinds of
fish which have four nostrils while all
other animals that smell at all seem
content with but two as a rule.</p>

<p>Only those animals having a backbone
are equipped with noses that are
unquestionably adapted to smelling,
but insects, crabs, and mollusks perceive
odors to a limited extent. Some of
them are readily deceived by odors
similar to those they seek. Lubbock
calls attention to the fact that the carrion
fly will deposit its eggs on any
plant that has a smell similar to that
of tainted flesh.</p>

<p>We are unable to say just what the
nature of a smelling substance is which
makes it so perceptible to our olfactory
organs. Many things, both organic
and inorganic, have the power
to affect us in a way which cannot be
perceived by the organs of taste nor
touch. The upper third of the interior
of the human nose has the sole function
of recognizing them. We have
almost no names for the various smells,
but they are as distinct as day and
night and arouse within us the most
intense feelings.</p>

<p>We are not only without names for
smells, but we are far from being
agreed as to the qualities of them. To
one person the odor of sweet peas is
delightful, while to another it is quite
the reverse. Sometimes we consider
a smell pleasant merely because of the
associations it brings. The odor of
pine lumber is grateful to one who has
spent a season in the lumber districts
where sawmills abound; and so the
smell of an ordinary lumber pile gives
pleasure to one where to another it is
somewhat disagreeable.</p>

<p>The sense of smell is one that tires
most readily. After smelling certain
odors for awhile one loses temporarily
the power to notice them at all. The
sense does not tire as a whole, but it
merely becomes inoperative with respect
to the odor continually present.
Almost any perfume held to the nose
soon loses its charm, and is only effective
again after a temporary absence.
But while one perfume is not sensed a
new one presented to the nostrils is
eagerly appreciated, showing the sense
to be fatigued only with regard to
what has been there for some time.
The owner of a large rendering establishment
in a city was called upon by a
committee of citizens who objected to
the smells arising from his plant. He
went out with the committee to inspect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the premises and declared with evident
honesty that he could detect nothing
disagreeable in the air nor any sort of
a scent that did not properly belong to
a rendering establishment. Those who
work where there are strong and disagreeable
odors soon become so accustomed
to peculiar smells that they do
not notice them at all, although they
are keen to detect any unusual odor,
as when the liquor in a tanner's vat has
not in it the proper admixture of materials.</p>

<p>All the lower animals seem to be
positive as to the direction of the
source of any scent, but man is powerless
in the matter. He merely knows
an odor is present, but is unable to tell
without moving about whether it comes
from one side of him or another. A
blindfolded boy cannot tell which side
of his nose is nearest to a suspended
orange.</p>

<p>To affect this sense a substance must
be dissolved or scattered through the
atmosphere to be breathed. Whether
such substances are divided and used
up in giving out odors is still a question.
Some of them, as the essential
oils, waste away when exposed to the
air, but a grain of musk remains a grain
of musk with undiminished power after
years of exposure. The experiment is
such a delicate one in connection with
the musk that it has never been settled
to the satisfaction of science.</p>

<p>Substances which scatter themselves
readily through the air are usually
odorous, while those which do not are
generally without smell. But many of
these when transformed into vapors, as
by the application of heat, become
strongly odorous. Bodies existing
naturally in the gaseous state are usually
the most penetrating and effective
as odors. Sulphuretted and carburetted
hydrogen are examples of these.</p>

<p>College boys sometimes procure
from the chemical laboratories of their
institutions materials which are used
with telling effect on the social functions
of higher or lower classes; in one
instance a banquet was cleared of guests
by the conscienceless introduction of
chemicals just before the festivities
were to have begun. Efforts to introduce
powerful gases as weapons in war
have failed because the effect is not
confined to the enemy.</p>

<p>Gases which are offensive are not
always positively harmful, but as a rule
those which offend the nose are to be
avoided. Some deadly gases do not
affect the sense of smell at all, as in the
case of earth damp which stupefies and
kills men in mines and wells without
warning. But the nose is a great detector
of bad air, especially that of a
noxious character, and sewer gas as
well as other poisonous airs which
bring on the worst types of fever are
offensive to one who is not living all
the time within their range.</p>

<p>But a small part of the mucous
membrane of the nose is the seat of this
important sense. The olfactory cells
are not as easily examined and traced
in their connections as are the end organs
of the sense of taste. Yet the
anatomist finds in the structure of the
noses of the flesh-eating animals sufficient
indications of their superiority
over man in the exercise of the sense
of smell. The peculiar development
of the membrane and the complicated
structure of the nasal cavities in the region
occupied by the cells which are
supposed to connect with the extreme
divisions of the olfactory nerve are all
that one would expect from the differences
in endowment.</p>

<p>Aside from peculiar powers of smell
there are other endowments of noses
which are remarkable. The common
hog has a snout that is easily moved
and has great strength. He can take
down a rail fence with it quite as skillfully
as a boy would do it. He can
turn a furrow in the soil in search of
eatable roots, and when the ground is
frozen to a considerable degree of hardness
he pursues his occupation with unabated
zeal and no evident embarrassment.</p>

<p>The fresh-water sturgeon has a large
gristle in his nose which boys sometimes
convert into a substitute for a
rubber ball. His nose is a useful instrument
in securing food from the
mud in the river bottom. The rhinoceros
has a fierce horny protuberance
rising from his nose which is valuable
to him in war. Indeed some are
equipped with two horns, one behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the other. The female rhinoceros
with one horn guides her calf with it,
causing him to move ahead of her, but
the female of the kind with two horns
does not use them upon her offspring
at all except in anger, and her calf is
content to follow her in feeding.</p>

<p>On the coast of California is a large
seal called the sea elephant which is
notable because the adult male has a
proboscis fifteen inches in length when
in ordinary temper, but under excitement
it is noticed to extend itself considerably
beyond its ordinary length.
The shrew, the tapir, and the horse
also possess something of a proboscis
which is useful in feeding.</p>

<p>But the elephant is the greatest animal
as to the development of this organ.
Insect-eating animals have snouts
of gristle, but the organ of prehension
of the elephant is composed almost entirely
of muscles of the most varied and
curious structure. Cuvier counted
twenty thousand muscles in an elephant's
trunk, and then gave up his unfinished task.</p>

<p>This great mass of muscular endowment
McCloskie says has improved his
intelligence which is not so great as is
popularly supposed. "Observation
shows the elephant after all to be rather
a stupid beast; it is the monkey, the
fox, and the crow which are credited
by the Hindoos with brute-cuteness,
whilst the highest measure of rationality
evinced by the elephant is when
he plucks off the branch of a tree, using
it as a whisk to drive off flies that torment
him. It seems that he is very
much afraid of flies, will take fright at
a mouse, and is always timid and suspicious,
none of these being traits of a
large mind."</p>

<p>The nose has been connected always
with the highest emotions of man. As
cats are transported into the seventh
heaven by the presence of their favorite
weed and rats are similarly affected
by rhodium, so man carries a perfume
in his pocket-handkerchief for his own
delectation or that of his friends, and
in many instances weaves into his worship
certain rites in which the burning
of incense and the offering of a sweet
savor has a prominent part. The Eskimo
shows his appreciation of his organ
of smell by putting it forward to
touch that of his friend whom he meets
on terms of special endearment.</p>

<p>Antony Van Corlear's large and rubicund
nose is gravely recorded by Irving
to have been the means of bringing
a great boon to the early inhabitants
of New Amsterdam because when
he fell asleep in a boat one day, the effulgence
of the sun at high meridian
fell upon his shining feature, was reflected
into the deep with such an undiminished
power that the beam came
into violent contact with a sturgeon,
and, by causing the death of the fish at
a time when the Dutch were willing to
experiment a little in the matter of gustation,
thus introduced the habit of eating
this excellent fish to the founders
of a great commonwealth.</p>

<p>That the near neighbors of the American
Dutch also held the nose in high
esteem is attested by the fact that
when among the American English
any of their divines in one
of their interminable sermons came
upon a series of unusually great
thoughts and carried the congregation
into the heights of sacred felicity they
acknowledged the divinity of the occasion
by "humming him through the
nose." Much of their singing also was
given an unction otherwise impossible
to it by their peculiar nasal attitude
while worshiping by use of the psalms.</p>

<p>While the nose is a most prominent
feature of the countenance and the
beauty of the face depends largely
upon that member's appearance, there
is no one who can say just what shape
the nose should have to be most beautiful.
Socrates proved his nose to be
handsomer than that of Alcibiades
because it was better adapted to use. As
the nose is used for smelling and the
eye for seeing, Socrates maintained that
the handsome eyes and nose of the
polished young Greek were less useful
and less adapted to the purposes for
which such organs exist, and therefore
the bulging eyes and violently turned-up
nose of the philosopher were held
to be more beautiful than those of Alcibiades.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE white ibis might well serve
as the text of a symposium
upon the evils of plume-hunting
to supply the constant demand of the
millinery trade. Suffice it to say here
that this species, in common with many
other members of its family, and many
other birds as well, has decreased to
the point of almost complete extermination
within the last fifteen years from
this cause alone. Surely it must be
true that the living bird in its natural
environment is far more pleasing to the
æsthetic sense than the few feathers
which are retained and put to an unnatural
use.</p>

<p>As lately as 1880 the white ibis was
decidedly numerous in the various
rookeries of the southern states, wandering
as far north as the Ohio river,
and touching southern Indiana and
southern Illinois. Two were seen as
far north as southern South Dakota.
They are now scarcely common even
in the most favored localities in Louisiana
and Texas, being confined to the
gulf states almost entirely, and even
there greatly restricted locally.</p>

<p>Like many of their near relatives, the
herons, the ibises not only roost together
in rookeries, but they also nest
in greater or less communities. Before
their ranks were so painfully thinned
by the plume-hunters, these nesting
communities contained hundreds and
even thousands of individuals. But now
only small companies can be found in
out-of-the-way places.</p>

<p>The nest is built upon the mangrove
bushes or upon the broken reeds and
rushes in the swamps, and is said to be
rather more carefully and compactly
built than are the herons' nests. The
eggs are three or four, rarely five in
number, and are laid about May 1 in
many localities, later in others. They
appear large for the bird. In shape
they are usually rather long ovate, and
in color are gray or ashy-blue, irregularly
and rather heavily blotched and
spotted with reddish and umber browns
of various shades. Some specimens
are very pretty.</p>

<p>The story of their great abundance,
persecution, rapid decline, and almost
death, if written, would read like some
horrible nightmare. Confident in the
apparent security of their ancestral
gathering-places, they fell an easy prey
to the avaricious plume-hunter who,
from some vantage-point, used his
almost noiseless light rifle or air-gun
with deadly effect, tallying his victims
by the hundred daily. We are sometimes
led to wonder if there is anything
so sacred as money.</p>

<p>We might be able to derive some
comfort from the thinning ranks of
many of our birds, perhaps, if we could
be sure that when these were gone the
work of extermination would cease.
But when one species disappears another,
less attractive before, will be set
upon, and thus the crusade, once begun,
will finally extend to each in turn.
This is not theory but fact. Nor will
the work of extermination cease with
the demand for plumes. Not until
repeated refusals of offered plumes
have impressed upon the mind of the
hunter the utter futility of further activity
in this line will he seek some
other occupation. It is a shame upon
us that killing birds should ever have
become an occupation of anyone. A
strong public sentiment against feather
adornments will yet save from destruction
many of our native birds. Can we
not arouse it?</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">AS the nesting-season of our feathered
friends approaches the
mind naturally reverts to the
grief in store for so many of
them. Notwithstanding the efforts of
the several Audubon societies, the
humane journals, and in rare instances
earnest pleas from the pulpit, fashion
decrees that the wearing of bird plumage,
and the birds themselves, is still
<i>de rigueur</i> among women. The past
season, certainly, showed no diminution
of this barbarous fashion&mdash;a humiliating
thing to record&mdash;and so the
beautiful creatures will continue to be
slaughtered, not by hundreds or thousands,
but by millions upon millions,
all for the gratification of woman's vanity
and a senseless love of display.</p>

<p>Alas, that the "fair" sex in whom the
quality of mercy is supposed to exist
in a high degree, should still wear
above their serene brows&mdash;often bowed
in worship&mdash;the badge of inhumanity
and heartlessness. That mothers who
have experienced all the pangs as well
as joys of motherhood can aid in breaking
up thousands of woodland homes
by wearing the plumage which makes
the slaughter of these birds one of commercial
value and necessity. Soon accounts
will be published of the fabulous
sums to be gained by the heron hunters,
and in order to supply the demand
for the filmy, delicate <i>aigrette</i> to adorn
my lady's bonnet, the nesting colony of
these snowy egrets will be visited by
the plume-hunters and the work of
slaughter begin. Love and anxiety for
their nestlings will render them heedless
of danger, and through all the days
of carnage which follow, not one parent
bird will desert its nest. Fortunately
the birds are instantly killed by the bullet,
else, stripped of the coveted plumes
they will be thrown in a heap, there
slowly to die within sight and hearing
of their starving, pleading little ones.
These have no value for the plume-hunter,
and so off he goes with his
spoil, leaving thousands of orphaned
nestlings to a painful, lingering death.
And all this for a plume, which, in
these days of enlightenment marks the
wearer either as a person of little education,
or totally lacking in refinement
of feeling. It is trite to say that motherhood
no more than womanhood necessarily
implies refinement in the individual,
but surely in the former, one would,
in the nature of things, expect to find
engendered a feeling of tender pity for
any helpless animal and its offspring.</p>

<p>It is this phase of the question which
particularly appeals to people in whom
love, as well as compassion for <i>all</i>
helpless creatures is strong, not a sentiment
newly awakened, or adopted as a
fad. That genuine love for animals is
inherent and not a matter of education
the close observer, I think, will admit.
Not that a child cannot be brought to
recognize, when caught in any act of
cruelty to some defenseless creature,
the wanton wickedness of his act, but
that no amount of suasion can influence
him to treat it with kindness for <i>love's</i>
sake rather than from the abstract moral
reason that it is right.</p>

<p>How can this love for animals exist
in a child who has never known the joy
of possessing a household pet? In whose
presence an intrusive dog or cat is ever
met with a blow, or angry command to
"get out?" When somebody's lost pet
comes whining at the door, piteously
pleading for a kindly pat, and a morsel
to eat, and is greeted with a kick, or possibly
a bullet, under the pretense that the
exhausted, panting little animal might
go mad? How can a child who has
witnessed these things view a suffering
animal with any other feeling but calm
indifference, or a brutal desire to inflict
upon it additional pain? In his estimation
every dog is subject to rabies,
and every cat infested with fleas.</p>

<p>Paternal apathy in this direction may,
to some extent, be remedied by the
child's instructors, especially in the
kindergarten, where the foundation of
character is supposed to be laid. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
even there the teacher will fail in arousing
a feeling of compassion in a naturally
cruel child's mind, unless her own
sympathies are genuine, and not assumed
for the time or place. Here
more than anywhere else, it seems to
me, intelligence, if not love, should
prompt the teacher to familiarize herself
with the treatment necessary not
only to the well-being but to the happiness
of the little captives held for the
purpose of nature-study in her class.</p>

<p>As spring opens, thousands of would-be
naturalists, stimulated by nature-study
in schools, will, no doubt, begin
their universal search for birds' eggs,
not from any particular interest in science,
but as they collect stamps or
marbles, simply to see how many they
can get. In this way millions of birds
are destroyed with no thought beyond
the transitory triumph and pleasure of
getting them. This egg-collecting
should not be encouraged by the teachers.
On the contrary every boy should
be told that a <i>true</i> naturalist does not
slaughter animals, or rob birds' nests
promiscuously; that he is the first to
remonstrate against wanton waste of
life; that he does not take eggs of common
birds at all, and never <i>empties</i> a
nest unless of a rare bird, and sometimes
not always then. These arguments
will prevail among a few who
have the real naturalist's instinct, but to
the many who either do not know, or
do not care, about the cruelty they inflict
upon the parent birds in thus robbing
them of their treasures, another
appeal must be made. Picture the
family life of the innocent little creatures&mdash;a
lesson indeed to people of
larger growth; how they guard their
nests with almost human care and wisdom,
and how they cherish their young
with as faithful and self-sacrificing love
as parents of human families. Impress
upon their young minds how many
days of toil the mother-bird, aided by
her mate, spent in building the nest
which they purpose to rifle, of her joy
and pride when the first egg was deposited,
and all the patiently borne days of
brooding which followed. Surely a
boy not wholly depraved would be
moved by such a recital, and thus thousands
of birds be saved, and through
their influence, protected. In this way,
too, might not the whole question of
slaughtering birds for millinery purposes
be solved, for what mother or sister
could turn a deaf ear to the reproaches
of a child, or to pleadings
from young lips for more humane treatment
of their feathered friends?</p>

<p>That the small boy is not without
wit, and quick to perceive the difference
between precept and practice, the
following anecdote, I think, will aptly
prove:</p>

<p>She was smartly dressed, and when
she met one of her scholars bearing off
a nest in which were five pretty little
speckled eggs, she did not hesitate to
stop him.</p>

<p>"You are a wicked boy," she exclaimed
indignantly. "How could you
rob the birds of their nest? No doubt,
at this very minute, the poor mother is
hovering about the tree grieving for
the loss of the eggs which you carry."</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, she don't care</i>," replied the
urchin, edging off with a derisive smile,
"<i>she's on your hat</i>."</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="24" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN botany this is the generic name of
a number of beautiful plants belonging
to the natural order of
<i>Iridaceæ</i>. The plants have a creeping
rootstock, or else a flat tuber, equitant
leaves, irregular flowers, and three
stamens. They are represented equally
in the temperate and hotter regions of
the globe. The wild species of iris are
generally called blue-flag, and the cultivated
flower-de-luce, from the French
<i>fleur de Louis</i>, it having been the device
of Louis VII. of France. Our commonest
blue-flag, <i>Iris versicolor</i>, is a
widely distributed plant, its violet-blue
flowers, as may be seen, upon stems one
to three feet high, being conspicuous
in wet places in early summer. The
root of this possesses cathartic and
diuretic properties, and is used by some
medical practitioners. The slender
blue-flag found in similar localities
near the Atlantic coast, is smaller
in all its parts. A yellowish or reddish-brown
species, resembling the
first named in appearance, is found
in Illinois and southward. There
are three native species which
grow only about six inches high and
have blue flowers. They are found in
Virginia and southward, and on the
shores of the great lakes; these are
sometimes seen as garden plants. The
orris root of commerce is the product
of <i>Iris Florentina</i>, <i>I. pallida</i>, and <i>I. Germanica</i>,
which grow wild in the south
of Europe; the rhizomes are pared and
dried, and exported from Trieste and
Leghorn, chiefly for the use of perfumers;
they have the odor of violets. The
garden species of iris are numerous,
and by crossing have produced a great
many known only by garden names.
The dwarf iris, <i>I. pumila</i>, from three to
six inches high, flowers very early and
makes good edgings to borders; the
common flower-de-luce of the gardens
is <i>I. Germanica</i>; the elder-scented
flower-de-luce is <i>I. sambucina</i>. These
and many others are hardy in our
climate, and readily multiplied by division
of their rootstocks. The mourning
or crape iris is one of the finest of
the genus, its flowers being very large,
dotted and striped with purple on a
gray ground. The flowers of most of
the species are beautiful. Some of
them have received much attention
from florists, particularly the Spanish,
English, and German, or common iris,
all corm-rooted species, and all European.
The Persian iris is delightfully
fragrant. The roots of all these species
are annually exported in considerable
quantities from Holland. The roasted
seeds of one species have been used as
a substitute for coffee.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">AS THE rose among flowers, so is
the peacock among the feathered
tribes.</p>

<p>No other bird has so many
colors in its plumage. Its hues are all
beautiful; the brilliant blue and black,
shot with gold, of the eyes of the tail,
the satin-like peacock blue of its neck
and breast, the shining green of its
back, each feather with its tiny eye of
brown, the clear brown of the stiff fan
that supports its tail, the soft gray
down that clothes its body&mdash;all are fit
robing for this royal bird.</p>

<p>In keeping with his kingly raiment is
his regal movement; so graceful, so
dignified, that one seems disposed to
believe the legend of India, his native
home, that he contains the metamorphosed
spirit of a peerless prince. I
have said that his step is kingly, yet
I am often disposed to yield to the
opinion of an old man who declared
that the gait of the peacock is queenly,
much like that of a beautiful and graceful
woman with a long train. Certain
it is, that nothing else can make such
an addition to a green lawn as a peacock,
stepping lightly along, keeping
his brilliant feathers swaying just above
the grass.</p>

<p>My West Virginia home has many
beauties of nature, shady dells where
waters sparkle, pastures that slope
toward the shining Ohio, lofty
trees that give shade to sleek cattle
and spirited horses; but amid all
these charms we have always rated
highly the gorgeous peacocks which
have so long adorned its grounds that
it has become known as the "Home of
the Peacocks." Though now sadly diminished
by poachers and hunters,
there were many years in which scores
of them, sometimes nearly a hundred,
strutted around our rural home.</p>

<p>The peacock's tail does not assume
full length and beauty until his fourth
or fifth year. The feathers begin to
grow in January, and by early spring
are long, and then his season of strutting
begins; and he spends a large part
of every day in this proud employment.
Each peacock has his favorite place of
strutting, and frequents it day after
day. Open gateposts are much sought
after; and our front gateposts have
always been favorite resting-places on
sunny afternoons, where these beauties
seemed posing to order.</p>

<p>For many seasons a very handsome
one strutted in front of our sitting-room
window. Some of the family slipped
over its neck a cord on which hung a
silver dime, which shone on its blue
feathers. Alas for his majesty! Strutting
in the road one day, a horse shied
at him, and its owner threw a stone and
killed the beauty.</p>

<p>The peahen, a meek-looking matron
with a green neck and long gray feathers,
is very secretive as to a nest, and
seeks an orchard or wheatfield. When
the little gray brood, from three to five
in number, are a few weeks old she
brings them to the yard.</p>

<p>Peafowls scorn the shelter of a house
and roost in the loftiest trees. Near
our home are some tall oaks and under
them they gather on summer evenings,
and, after many shrill good-night cries,
fly upward to the high limbs.</p>

<p>In cold weather they do not come
down until late in the day. Sometimes
on snowy days they get so weighted
with snow that they cannot fly up, and
so settle on the ground, and their long
feathers freezing, have to be cut loose.
In June or early July their feathers begin
to drop, and to secure them they
must be plucked. Though so docile as
to frequent the porches, they do not
like to be caught, but take to the wing,
so a rainy day is selected, when their
feathers are weighted with water, and
they are soon chased down. After being
plucked they are unsteady in gait
and hide in the bushes for days.</p>

<p>Peafowls have a strong home-feeling
and when taken away are hard to retain;
as they wander off, striving to return.
They are enemies to young
chickens, and are exasperating to the
good housewife, as they are hard to
drive away, performing a circle and returning.
The peafowl is almost as
good a table fowl as the turkey.</p>

<h2><a name="OWLS" id="OWLS"></a>OWLS.</h2>

<p class="ac smaller">JOHN WINTHROP SCOTT.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_b.jpg" width="56" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">BIRDS that fly in the night and
whose wings move so smoothly
through the air that they make
no noise act much like the burglar
that gets into your house quietly
when you are asleep to steal your
money. But the owl is not a burglar.
He is the friend of man. There is no
other bird that does the farmer so much
good as the owl. The owl comes out
in the dark to get the small animals
that are out at that time stealing things
from the farmer. So we may call the
owl the night watchman of the farm.
He sometimes comes out in the daytime,
but most owls prefer the night or
at least a dark day.</p>

<p>The owl has been called a wise bird
for the same reason that some men are
thought to be wise&mdash;he looks wise.
One reason he looks so steadily at you
that you think he is studying you is because
the light is so strong in the daytime
that his sight is bad. But the owl
is not as wise as he is said to be. He
does some foolish things as well as
other birds. In fact he is sometimes
more foolish than any other bird would
be in the same place. One owl was
known to sit for more than a half day
under a leaking water tap. The water
fell at the rate of twenty drops a minute
right down upon the owl's head,
and yet he was not wise enough to
move out of the wet.</p>

<p>All owls are not too stupid to learn.
Puffy, a tame young owl, caught and
ate a two-pound pullet. An old hen
afterwards took a fancy to his perch.
She went in and gave the little owl a
sound whipping, and after that shared
the perch with him. He never forgot
the lesson the hen had given him and
always treated her well.</p>

<p>Owls have a way of hiding from
notice by making believe they are
something besides owls. They can
move their feathers so as to change
their looks entirely. The great horned
owl sometimes makes himself a frightful
mass of feathers a yard wide, and
at other times he seems to be a very
slim bird, too thin for an owl. Puffy
once got away from his master. He
flew to the top of a stump and sat like
a stake for an hour while his master
looked all round the place for him
without knowing there was a bird on
the stump in plain sight. Owls draw
the feathers away from their mouths in
an odd way when they eat, and when
walking softly to steal upon a mouse
tuck up their feathers as a lady lifts her
skirts.</p>

<p>Owls are fond of mice. A boy who
had a half-grown barn owl tried him
one day to see how many mice he
would eat. The first four mice went
down the owl's throat very quickly.
Then number five and number six were
eaten in a short time. Number seven
did not go down quite as rapidly and
number eight was slower still. Number
nine was taken greedily, but the
owl could not swallow it. The tail
hung out of the owl's mouth for awhile
before it could be fairly counted. Then
no more were eaten till about three
hours after, when the owl was pleased
to take four more mice.</p>

<p>The gopher is a small animal that
does damage to growing things. It
digs up corn after it is planted, and it
gnaws the roots of fruit trees so as to
hurt them badly. Owls catch gophers
and eat them. This is one reason why
the farmer likes the owl so well. Barn
owls sometimes roost with pigeons, but
they are good friends. We know they
do not eat the pigeons because owls
swallow their food whole and have to
throw up the bones afterwards, and it
is known that the owls living with the
pigeons throw up bones of rats and
mice but not of pigeons.</p>

<p>Sometimes so many mice have come
upon the farms in England that it looked
as if everything would be eaten up by
them. But a great many owls always
came when the mice were so thick and
helped the farmers save their crops. One
owl was seen to make, in thirty minutes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
seventeen trips to her young with
food.</p>

<p>A gentleman living in the West when
there was so much damage done by
grasshoppers found that the owls were
living on them and not eating much of
any other kind of food. The only way
he could tell what the owls had for
supper was to shoot an owl once in
awhile and see what was in its stomach.
One barn owl had thirty-nine locusts,
twenty-two other insects, and one
mouse which it had just taken. Screech
owls and burrowing owls usually had
more than two dozen locusts, and some
of them had other kinds of insects.</p>

<p>A rabbit, a weasel, a mink, or even a
skunk is good eating for the owl. And
there are times when one owl will make
a meal of another owl of smaller size.
A large red-tailed hawk was once put
into a garret where there was a snowy
owl. That night the hawk was killed
and partly eaten by the owl. A tame
great horned owl and a little screech
owl were shut up in a hay loft together.
The wings of the big owl were cut so
he could not fly. After about a week
they both became one owl, and that
owl threw up the claws, beak, bones,
and feathers which had once been useful
to the little screech owl.</p>

<p>Owls sometimes catch partridges and
quails. This is not so bad, for they
pick out the weak birds that are not
well, and so keep disease from spreading
among the fine birds. A hunter
once shot a bob white so that it was
not killed but could not fly. He and
his dog were chasing the bird in the
grass along a fence hoping to catch it.
An owl saw the wounded bird and
thought it belonged to him because it
was not well. He came out of the woods
very swiftly and picked up the bob
white right before the eyes of the
hunter.</p>

<p>In woods where there are panthers
one will often hear in the night fearful
cries that make it seem as if some wild
beast were about to jump down from
some tree near by to kill the one who
is out so late. Most of these cries
which frighten people so are made by
hoot owls. But it is not easy to tell
whether the sound comes from a hoot
owl or from the throat of a wild cat.
There is a saying among country people
who wish to seem wise: "I wasn't
brought up in the woods to be afraid
of owls."</p>

<p>The hoot owl has so many wild notes
in his voice that it is not at all strange
that he scares people who have not
been brought up in the woods. Before
he sends out his proper hoot he
sometimes seems to try to frighten
everybody out of the forest with his
awful shrieks. Sometimes several hoot
owls get together in the night to hold
a concert. One of them seems to tell a
funny story and all the rest break out
with shouts of <i>he-he-he-he-hi-hi-hi-hi-ha-ha-ha-ha</i>,
and then they become as
solemn as any other owls, and the stillness
of the night is perfect until another
owl has a droll story or song to set the
rest a-shouting at.</p>

<p>The owl is brave. One that weighed
less than six ounces once fought a nine-pound
rooster. A teamster in Maine
once went to sleep on top of his load
while his horses ate their oats beside a
forest road. When he pulled the
blanket away from his face an owl
pounced down upon it, perhaps thinking
his white skin was a rabbit, and
tore his cheeks fiercely. He was much
frightened, having just awakened. But
he caught the owl and killed it after a
short struggle, and called himself
lucky because his eyes were not put
out by the bird.</p>

<p>If the owl is a sober and wise bird
he forgets all about it when he woos
his mate. Such awkward dancing and
foolish boo-hoo-ing is never seen except
when the owl is trying to choose
a mate for life. But he makes up for
his awkwardness when there are eggs
to sit upon, for the owl is the best husband
a bird ever had. When there is
room in the old hollow where the nest
is he will sit on the eggs with his wife
and help her hatch the puffy little owl
children.</p>

<p>Owls are the best of parents, too,
for they will risk their own lives freely
to protect their young. If their nests
are robbed and the old birds can find
where their young ones are caged they
will come daily with food for them
though they are in great danger in doing
so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>They lay their eggs earlier than
other birds, and often the falling snow
covers the back of the sitting bird.
The warmth of her body melts it so
that water runs gently down through
the nest and forms icicles that hang
below and glisten in the sunshine to
tell of the faithful conduct of the
mother owl.</p>

<p>Small birds, as a rule, hate owls, and
they delight in getting round these great
awkward fellows whenever they can
catch them by day and doing all they
can to hurt their feelings. Bird-catchers
sometimes catch small birds because
they are so fond of teasing owls.
An owl is caught and tied to a tree.
The tree is covered with sticky stuff
called bird lime. As soon as a little
bird sees the owl in the tree he cries to
his friends and they come in great
crowds to tease the owl. But the
small birds find their desire to torment
ends in their own capture, for they
cannot get away from the bird lime
until the trapper comes along and
gathers all the little birds that are
hanging to the sticky limbs and twigs
about the big bird they were trying to
tease.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DUCK_MOLE" id="THE_DUCK_MOLE"></a>THE DUCK MOLE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_w.jpg" width="66" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WE ARE indebted to Dr. George
Bennett for the first good description
of the duck mole (<i>Ornithorhynchus
anatinus</i>) which
was an object of wonder to naturalists
long after its discovery. This enthusiastic
investigator traveled to Australia
for the sole purpose of observing the
animal. Up to that time little was
known of it. We simply knew that
the duck mole lives in the water and
was persistently hunted by the natives,
as it yielded a savory flesh and laid
eggs. The latter discovery was made
by Caldwell in 1884.</p>

<p>The duck mole is about two feet
in length, six inches of which are included
in the tail. The males are
larger than the females. The legs are
very small, all four feet being five-toed
and webbed. All the toes are very
strong, blunt, and excellently adapted
for digging. The middle toes are the
longest. The tail is flat and is broad
at the end, the extremity being formed
by long hairs. It is abruptly cut off,
and in old animals is either entirely
naked beneath or covered with a few
coarse hairs. In young animals it is
quite hairy. The adult animal has
only four horny teeth in its two jaws,
of which the upper front tooth is broad
and flat and resembles a grinder.</p>

<p>The fur of the duck mole consists of
a coarse outer coat of a dark brown
color with a silvery-white surface tinge,
and a very soft, grayish inner fur, similar
to that of the seal and the otter. A
peculiar fish-like odor is given forth by
the fur, especially when it is wet. The
Australians, however, are very fond of
the flesh of the animal in spite of its
disgusting odor. The duck mole is
said to be fondest of calm spots in
rivers filled with aquatic plants and the
banks of which are shaded by the dense
foliage of trees; and it constructs more
or less complicated burrows in the
banks. A tunnel about eighteen feet
long terminates in a large chamber,
both the chamber and its approaches
being strewn with dry aquatic plants.
The chamber usually has two entrances,
one below the surface of the water, and
the other about twelve inches above.</p>

<p>The duck moles are seen at all times
in the rivers of Australia, especially
during the spring and summer. They
emerge from their retreats at dusk,
though they sometimes also appear in
the day time, searching for food.
When the water is clear, the observer
can follow with the eye the movements
of the animal as it dives and reappears
above the surface. It likes to
stay near the shore, amidst the mud,
searching for its food between the roots
of the plants, where insects abound.
The mollusks which it captures in its
forays it stores temporarily in its cheek-pouches
and then consumes them at
greater leisure.</p>

<p>"On a beautiful summer evening,"
says Bennett, "I approached a small
river in Australia, and as I knew the
predilection of the duck mole for the
hour of dusk, I tried to obtain a
glimpse of one. With a constant
grasp on our guns, we patiently stood
on the shore. It was not long before
we saw a black object appear near us
on the top of the water, the head being
raised but little above the surface.
We stood motionless, lest we should
scare the animal, carefully observing
and following its movements, for one
must be ready to shoot just as the duck
mole reappears after diving. Only a
shot in the head is effective, as the
loose, thick fur will not allow a bullet
to penetrate it readily. We wounded
one which gave evidence of severe injury
and sank immediately, but soon
rose again. When the dog brought it
to us we found it to be a fine male.
Several minutes after it had been
brought out of the water it apparently
revived, and, instantly rising to its feet,
staggered toward the river. About
twenty-five minutes later it turned over
several times and then died. As I had
heard much about the danger of being
pierced by its spur even when the animal
is mortally injured, I put my hand
near the so-called poisonous spur at
the first grasp. In its violent exertions
to escape the animal scratched me
slightly with its hind paws and also
with its spur, but despite the roughness
with which I seized it, it did not wound
me intentionally. I had also been
further told that the duck mole lay on
its back when it wished to use the spur,
which statement will not be received as
at all probable by anyone who knows
the animal in ever so slight a way. I
put it in this position, but it only strove
to regain its feet without attempting to
wound me by using its spur. In short,
I tried in every way to induce the animal
to make use of its spur as a weapon,
but in vain; and I am perfectly
convinced that the spur has another
function than that of a weapon. The
natives characterize the spur as 'mischievous,'
that being with them a word
which in general conveys the idea of
dangerous or poisonous character; yet
they use the same expression in speaking
of the scratches inflicted by the animal
with the hinder feet, and they are
not at all afraid of seizing a living duck
mole. When the queer creature runs
along the ground, it produces an impression
of something unnatural, and
its strange shape easily startles a timid
person. Cats instantly take flight at
its appearance, and even dogs, which
are not specially trained, stare at it,
prick their ears, and bark, but are
afraid to touch it."</p>

<p>On another voyage Bennett discovered
a burrow containing three young
ones, upon which the hair had already
grown, and which he could observe for
some time. When he found the nest
with the young ones and placed them
on the ground, they ran to and fro, but
did not make such savage attempts to
escape as did the old ones. The natives,
whose mouths watered at the
sight of these fat young animals, said
that they were about eight months old,
and added that the young duck moles
were fed milk by their mother only
during their early infancy and later
were given insects, small shells, and
mud.</p>

<p>At evening Bennett's two little pets
emerged from their cage at dusk and
usually ate their food; then they began
to play like a couple of young dogs,
attacking each other with their beaks,
lifting their fore paws and climbing
over each other. They were very
lively. Their little eyes gleamed and the
apertures of the ears opened and closed
in remarkably rapid succession. As
their eyes stand quite high on their
heads they cannot see very well straight
ahead, and therefore are apt to come
into collision with near-by objects. The
young animals survived only five weeks.</p>

<p>The duck mole lays several soft-shelled
eggs. The eggs are hatched in
the nest. The newly-hatched young
are small, naked, blind and as helpless
as those of the pouched animals. Their
beaks are short.</p>

<p>In the zoölogical garden at Melbourne
duck moles have occasionally
been kept of late years, but none have,
thus far, reached Europe or America
alive.</p>

<p>Brehm says that the duck mole is the
last among the known mammals.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HIBERNATION_OF_ANIMALS" id="THE_HIBERNATION_OF_ANIMALS"></a>
  THE HIBERNATION OF ANIMALS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_n.jpg" width="56" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">NATURE presents no greater or
more curious phenomenon than
the habit of certain animals to
conceal themselves and lie dormant,
in a lethargic sleep, for weeks
and months. It is known that in perfect
hibernators the processes of nature
are interrupted during the period of
this long insensibility. Breathing is
nearly, and in some animals, entirely
suspended, and the temperature of the
blood even in the warmer blooded animals,
falls so low that how life can be
maintained in them is a great mystery.</p>

<p>A variety of Rocky Mountain ground
squirrels, when in perfect hibernation,
says an observer, has a temperature
only three degrees above freezing point
of water, and when taken from their
burrows are as rigid as if they were not
only dead, but frozen. But a few minutes
in a warm room will show that
they are not only alive, but full of life.</p>

<p>As to the suspension of breathing in
hibernators, the fact is proved sufficiently
in the instances of the raccoon
and the woodchuck. When they have
laid themselves away for the winter
sleep they roll themselves up comfortably
and press their noses in such a
position against their hinder parts that
it would be an absolute impossibility
for them to draw a breath. It is generally
supposed that the bear rolls
itself up in this way and does not
breathe, but the holes melted in the
snow beneath which the animal frequently
stows itself, under a covering
of leaves, prove that it does breathe
while in its lethargy.</p>

<p>The marmot family produces the
soundest winter sleepers. When the
marmot is in its peculiar state of hibernation
the electric spark will not rouse
it. The most noxious gases do not
affect it in the slightest. If its temperature
is raised above that at which the
animal breathed in its natural state it
will die almost immediately.</p>

<p>Our own familiar wild animals, the
bear, the raccoon, and the woodchuck&mdash;the
so-called ground-hog&mdash;are classed
as perfect hibernators, because they
store no food for winter, but have
acquired or provided themselves with
a thick, fatty secretion between the
skin and flesh, which, it is supposed,
supplies them with sustenance. As a
matter of fact, although dormant animals
absorb fat, it does not enter into
their digestive organs. Food introduced
into the stomach of a hibernating
animal, or reptile, by force or
artificial means, will be found undigested
at all stages of its lethargy,
for it invariably goes into its peculiar
state on an empty stomach. That is
one of the mysteries of the phenomenon,
not so great, however, as the fact
that bears and woodchucks produce
their young during their winter sleep.
The male bear is frequently roused
from his sleep and is found by the
woodsman roaming about in mid-winter,
but they have never known, they say,
a female bear to be killed after the season
for hibernation has set in.</p>

<p>Squirrels are only partial hibernators,
from the fact that they work all
summer and fall storing great quantities
of food to supply them when hunger
wakes them up during the winter,
some of them, no doubt, spending very
little time in a lethargic sleep.</p>

<p>The common land tortoise, no matter
where it may be, and it is a voracious
feeder, goes to sleep in November
and does not wake up again till
May, and that curious animal, the
hedgehog, goes to sleep as soon as the
weather gets cold and remains in unbroken
slumber six months.</p>

<p>Bats, at the beginning of cold
weather, begin to huddle together in
bunches in hollow trees, dark corners
in deserted houses, and in caves and
crevices in the rocks. They gradually
lose all sensibility, and continue in a
comatose state until the return of genuine
warm weather. When you see the
first bat of the season fluttering at
nightfall you can be sure that warm
weather has come to stay. The little
hooks at the end of one of the joints of
each wing are what the bat hangs itself
up by when it goes to sleep, whether
for a day or for months. When the
bats are clustering for hibernation one
of the number hangs itself up by its
hooks, head downward, and the others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
cling to it. It is on record that sixty
bats have been found in one cluster, the
entire weight of the lot being sustained
by the one bat clinging with its hooks
to whatever it had fastened them to at
the start&mdash;a weight of at least ten
pounds. The position of the central
bat in such a cluster would be like that
of a man hanging by his thumb-nails
and supporting the weight of fifty-nine
other men. So completely is animation
suspended in the bat during the
cold months that no test yet applied
has induced it to show the least sign of
life. Torpid bats have been inclosed
by the hour in air-tight glass jars and
not a particle of oxygen in the jars
has been exhausted when they were
taken out, showing that the bats had
not breathed.</p>

<p>As cold drives certain animals, insects,
and reptiles to a state of torpidity,
so heat and lack of water bring
about the same condition in others.
The animal or reptile that hibernates,
or goes to sleep in cold weather, arranges
its body so that it will conduce
to the greatest warmth, while those
that estivate, or become torpid in warm
weather, place themselves in positions
that show that they want all the coolness
the climate will permit. The tenric,
a tropical animal, carnivorous and
insectivorous, becomes torpid during
the greatest heat, and lies on its back
with its body drawn to its greatest
length, and its limbs spread wide apart.
Snakes estivate in the South, all kinds
together, just as snakes hibernate in
the North, but instead of rolling themselves
in great balls, as the northern
snakes do, they lie singly, and stretched
to their full length.</p>

<p>Want of water will cause the common
garden snail to go into a state of
the most complete and curious lethargy.
This is the snail of the genus Limax,
not the larger one of the genus Helix.
In the latter the phenomenon of hibernation
is especially remarkable. In
November the snail forms just a soft,
silky membrane across the external
opening of its shell. On the inner surface
of that it deposits a coating of
carbonate of lime, which immediately
hardens the gypsum. This partition is
again lined with a silky membrane.
The snail then retires a little further
into the shell and forms a second membranous
partition, retiring again and
again until there are six of these partitions
between the snail and the lime-coated
door at the entrance of the
shell. In the recess behind all these
partitions the snail lies torpid until May.
All this time it lives without motion,
without heat, without food, without air,
without circulation or the exercise of
any of its functions. If this snail is
prevented from hibernating for several
seasons by keeping it in a warm room,
it will gradually waste away and die.
A case is known where several snails
of this genus were shut in a perforated
box without food or water. They retired
into their shells and closed them
with a thin membrane. They remained
so for three years, but revived when
put into torpid water. They had been
driven into torpidity by drought. The
blood of this animal is white.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to state in connection
with these animals who pass
half the year, or less, in sleep, that
there are several species of fish, reptiles,
and insects which never sleep during
their stay in this world. Among fish
it is now positively known that pike,
salmon, and gold-fish never sleep at
all. Also that there are several others
of the fish family that never sleep more
than a few minutes during a month.
There are dozens of species of flies
which never indulge in slumber, and
from three to five species of serpents
which the naturalists have never been
able to catch napping.</p>

<p class="ac smaller">LYNDS JONES.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THERE is hardly another group
of birds that yields so satisfactory
returns for earnest study
as the American wood warblers. All
shades and patterns of color are theirs,
from somber to brilliant, from the plainest
to the most intricate and exquisite
pattern. Almost all degrees of vocal
ability are found among them, from
the simple twitter of the Tennessee to
the wild thrilling challenge of the
Louisiana water thrush or the ventriloquial
antics of the yellow-breasted chat.
Many bird students, it is true, regard
the group as too difficult for any but
the professional ornithologist to attempt;
and that may be true of the females
and of the autumnal plumages of
the young, but the spring males are a
constant inspiration and delight to one
who admires variety in beauty.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the small
size of the warblers renders their field
study difficult, even if the foliage does
not prove a serious hindrance. One
must remember, however, that most
small birds are not wary and that they
may be closely approached, so that,
with a good field-glass (and every bird-student
should use one) their colors and
the pattern of their dress can readily be
made out even in the lower tree tops,
where many of them feed. Foliage is
always in the way, but even that can be
circumvented by patience and perseverance.</p>

<p>The study of adult males in spring is
greatly aided by the fact that each
species, with some exceptions, has one
or more patches of color peculiar to
itself. Thus in the Cape May warbler
the ear patches are rufous. Other species
possess rufous colors, but none of
them in this place.</p>

<p>The Cape May warbler belongs among
the less common species, but may be common
for a day or two during the height
of the migration. It is very fond of orchards
where it feeds among the foliage,
snatching an insect here, a larva there,
and cleaning the bundle of eggs from
the leaf over yonder with an untiring
energy. They also associate more or
less with the other warblers in the
woods. They are of great value to the
fruit grower.</p>

<p>This species is found from the Atlantic
coast west to the plains and north
to Hudson's Bay, passing the winter in
the tropics. It breeds from northern
New England to Hudson's Bay and
probably in northern Minnesota. The
nest is built in a low bush in a wooded
pasture or open woodland, said to be
partially pensile. The nest and eggs
are not readily distinguishable from
those of several other warblers. The
males sing frequently from their perch
on the topmost twig of a spruce tree,
thus misleading one as to the whereabouts
of the female and nest. The
song resembles somewhat that of the
black and white warbler, but is rather
less wiry. It cannot be represented on
paper.</p>

<p>The tongue of this bird is worthy of
special notice. It is cleft at the tip,
and is provided with somewhat of a
fringe. This character is not peculiar
to this species, but is found in some
honey creepers and in at least one foreign
family of birds, thus suggesting, at
least, the relationship of the warblers
as a group. It might be asked, what is
the significance of this character as
regards feeding-habits? Apparently
nothing, since the feeding-habits and
food do not differ from those of other
warblers not having the cleft tongue as
greatly as the tongues themselves differ
in structure. It is apparently an
aberrant character developed somewhat
at random among groups nearly
related, or perhaps a remnant of structure.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WHILE a British brig was gliding
smoothly along before a good
breeze in the South Pacific, a
flock of small birds about the
size, shape, and color of paroquets settled
down in the rigging and passed an
hour or more resting. The second
mate was so anxious to find out the
species to which the visiting strangers
belonged that he tried to entrap a specimen,
but the birds were too shy
to be thus caught and too spry to be
seized by the quick hands of the sailors.
At the end of about an hour the birds
took the brig's course, and disappeared,
but towards nightfall they came back
and passed the night in the main-top.
The next morning the birds flew off
again, and when they returned at noon
the sailors scattered some food about
the decks. By this time the birds had
become so tame that they hopped about
the decks, picking up the crumbs. That
afternoon an astonishing thing happened.
The flock came flying swiftly
toward the brig. Every bird seemed
to be piping as if pursued by some little
invisible enemy on wings, and they at
once huddled down behind the deck-house.
The superstitious sailors at
once called the captain of the brig,
who rubbed his eyes and looked at the
barometer. A glance showed that
something was wrong with the elements
and the brig was put in shape to out-ride
a storm. The storm came down
about twenty minutes after the birds
had reached the vessel. For a few minutes
the sky was like the waterless bottom
of a lake&mdash;a vast arch of yellowish
mud&mdash;and torrents of rain fell. Why
it did not blow very hard, no one knows;
but on reaching port, two days later,
the captain learned that a great tornado
had swept across that part of the
sea. The birds left the vessel on the
morning after the storm and were not
seen again.</p>

<h2><a name="A_WINDOW_STUDY" id="A_WINDOW_STUDY"></a>A WINDOW STUDY.</h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ONE of the best places to study
birds is from behind the blinds
of a conveniently-placed window,
where one can see without
being seen.</p>

<p>My window one July looked into
the tops of tall spruce trees, relieved
here and there by a pine, a birch, or a
maple. This was the home of the
most fascinating and the most bewildering
of feathered tribes, the warblers,
and a rugged old spruce tree was a
favorite "Inn of Rest" for every bird
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>In all the years that I have known
birds I have carefully avoided becoming
interested in warblers, so tiny, so
restless, so addicted to the upper
branches, so every way tantalizing to
study. But here, without intention on
my part, fate had opened my windows
into their native haunts, even into the
very tree-tops where they dwell. "He
strives in vain who strives with fate."
After one protest I succumbed to their
charms.</p>

<p>My principal visitor was a beauty,
like most of his distinguished family,
having a bright yellow head, set off by
a broad black band beginning at the
throat and running far down the sides,
and he bore the awkward name "black-throated
green warbler."</p>

<p>A bewitching and famous singer is
this atom in black and gold. And not
only is his song the sweetest and most
winning, but the most unique, and&mdash;what
is not generally known&mdash;the most
varied.</p>

<p>The song that has been oftenest
noticed, and is considered characteristic
of the species, is sometimes syllabled
as "trees, trees, beautiful trees," sometimes
as "hear me Saint Theresa."
But in my intimate acquaintance with
some of the family that July I noted
down from my window alone eight distinctly
different melodies. My special
little neighbor, who spent hours every
day in the old spruce, sang the regulation
carol of his tribe, but he also indulged
in at least one other totally unlike
that. Those two I have heard and
seen him sing, one directly after the
other, but he may have had half a
dozen arrangements of his sweet notes.</p>

<p>Sometimes the mate of my spruce-tree
neighbor appeared on the tree,
going over the branches in a businesslike
way, and uttering a loud, sharp
"chip."</p>

<p>One morning there suddenly broke
out in the old spruce a great clatter of
"tick-et! tick-et!" in the voice of a
nestling. I snatched my glass and
turned it at once upon a much-excited
warbler, my black-throated green. He
was hopping about in a way unusual
even with him, and from every side
came the thread-like cries, while the
swaying of twigs pointed out a whole
family of little folk, scrambling about
in warbler fashion and calling like bigger
bird babies for food. They were
plainly just out of the nest, and then I
studied my spruce-tree bird in a new
role, the father of a family.</p>

<p>He was charming in that as in every
other, and he was evidently a "good
provider," for I often saw him after
that day going about in great anxiety,
looking here and there and everywhere,
while a small green worm in the
beak told plainly enough that he was
seeking his wandering offspring.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the month
I frequently saw, and more frequently
heard, the little family as they followed
their busy parents around on the neighboring
trees.</p>

<p>One day I noted the singer flitting
about the top of the spruce, singing
most joyously, and almost as constantly
as before the advent of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
nestlings, while the mother was hurrying
over the lower branches of the
same tree, collecting food for one
youngster. Suddenly the song ceased,
and the tiny papa joined the family
party below, and addressed himself
with his usual energy to the business
of filling that greedy mouth.</p>

<p>Over and under and around and
through the branches he rushed, every
few seconds returning to stuff a morsel
into the always hungry mouth, till he
actually reduced that infant to silence,
and then he slipped away, returned to
his tree top, and resumed his lovely
"tee-tee-tweetum!"</p>

<p>Somewhat later I heard the baby
black-throats at their practice, droll,
quavering attempts to imitate the musical
song of their father. They soon
mastered the notes, but the spirit was
as yet far beyond them.</p>

<p>This happy life went on before my
window till, almost at the end of July,
a heavy fog swept in one evening from
the ocean, and when, the next day, a
cool north wind blew it back whence
it came, it seemed to take the whole
tribe of warblers with it. August was
now upon the threshold, and in the
bird world at least</p>

<p class="drop-cap">OUT of the woods they come, visiting
our homes wherever they
see a standing invitation in the
shape of a tree. But each one
has his preferences. One likes the
evergreens best, another the bare trunk
where it is easy to break the bark, and
still another likes a fresh tree like the
magnolia, glossy and full of life even in
winter. You have guessed these are
birds? Yes; and the small downy
woodpecker comes first, and in all
weathers. The other day after a sun-rise
of gold and a splendid rainbow
arch, swiftly blotted out by a black
storm with scudding rain and flying
leaves, I caught sight of a tiny downy,
in the very heart of all the uproar of
the elements, busily pecking his way
up a tree near my window. On another
winter day, sunny and calm, he
came flying overhead with a loud rattling
note that spoke of good cheer in
most neighborly fashion. It is a family,
at the very least, that visits us. There
are variations in size, if I mistake not,
and one day a pair arrived together; the
female with her glossy black velvet
crown almost as handsome with her
broad white satin stripe down the middle,
and black and white markings, as
her mate, who, indeed, only outshines
her by the lovely band of red on the
head or nape of his neck, as you choose
to call it. I fancy she is the more anxious
housekeeper. At least, it was her
persistent call-note, rather sharp in tone,
that drew me from my lounge to watch
her quick movements on the bark, and
it is she that more quickly takes flight.
He seems never disturbed by his inquisitive
human neighbors, nor even
the impudent sparrows&mdash;though he can
send these to the right about if he
pleases&mdash;and his tap, tap, tap, like a
small drummer on the tree-trunk, is
always pleasant to hear. I am glad to
know they both have a cozy little home,
a hole on the southern side of a tree,
where the sun shines on good days,
and fancy them tucked into round balls
of feathers, only to be distinguished by
the red on top, and comfortably asleep,
when neither pleasure nor necessity invites
them abroad.</p>

<p>The yellow-bellied sapsucker is also
a winter guest, but he is far more timid
than the downy, and I have often seen
him routed by the sparrows or scared
off by a sudden sound. The male is
very gay in plumage, with much mottled
yellowish brown on back, conspicuous
white stripes on wings, beautiful clear
yellow and black in front, scarlet on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
head and cardinal at his throat. The
female has a white throat and cardinal
or black cap. I have noticed one with
a cardinal cap that had little black
feathers sticking here and there like an
emery bag. They are very full of fun,
even riotous in play, and shout, in their
summer home&mdash;the woods of the north&mdash;but
they are very quiet when wintering
with us, and often flit away without
a sound.</p>

<p>Of the nuthatches, the pretty white-breasted
one with his soft bluish-grey
coat and shining black head, is our familiar
resident and the red-breasted an
occasional winter companion. They
are charming little birds, not specially
musical, though their call is
vigorous and friendly, but very pretty
and gentle, and awakening perpetual
wonder and admiration at their feats as
acrobats, running as lightly head downwards
as in a natural position, and showing
equal swiftness and grace in every
movement, whether with aid of wings
or without. They never seem in the
least afraid of us, but raise their softly
rounded heads and look at us with a
most delightful confidence.</p>

<p>The brown creeper is like a bit of the
trunk in his brown tints, mottled as if
in mimicry of the play of light and
shadow on the bark. He is as truly a
tree-creature as ever Greek fable devised,
and can so flatten himself,
when alarmed, against a tree that no
inch of his light breast is visible, and it
is difficult, indeed, to recognize him as
a separate being. He is the one
species found in America of quite
a large Old World family, and has some
odd characteristics. First, his long tail,
used to aid him in climbing, is rather
curved and stiff and generally worn by
constant use. His bill is also curved,
so that the profile of his figure is like a
relaxed bow as he works his plodding
way up the side of the tree, diligently
seeking insects, eggs, and larvæ, in the
minute crevices of the bark. He sticks
his little nest, made, of course, of bits
of dead wood, bark, and twigs, between
the tree and a strip of loose bark, very
like a part of the tree itself, and the
eggs are spotted and dotted with wood
colors, brown in different shades, and
lavender. Altogether his life is a tree-study;
the tree is to him home, model,
hunting-ground, hiding-place, and refuge.
He never descends by creeping,
but when he wants to search a lower
part of the trunk, he flies to the base,
and begins it all over again. In the
summer fir-wood, farther northward, it
is said he sings, but in winter-time we
hear only a faint squeak, a little like
one bough scraping against another.</p>

<p>The black-and-white creeping warbler
is very like our sober brown creeper
in habit, but he, like most of his gay
brethren, is only a summer guest. In
his place we have Carolina chickadees
and golden-crowned kinglets&mdash;and even,
by good luck, an occasional ruby-crowned.
All these tiny creatures have
the most charming and airy ways of
flitting from bough to bough, swinging
lightly from the utmost end of a
bough, daintily dropping to unexpected
resting-places, and rarely pausing
for a second's breathing-time anywhere.
The Carolina chickadee is said
to have a longer note and more varied
<i>repertoire</i> than his northern cousin, yet
whenever I have heard him in winter
weather, there is the same silvery and
joyous tinkle of showering <i>Chick-a-dee-dee-dees</i>
from the pretty gray and black-capped
flock that I have heard in Massachusetts.
Perhaps the variations are
more evident in his summer singing.</p>

<p>I have left the kinglet for the last, but
it is hard to do justice to this lovely
little bird that, if the food-supply be all
right, will often elect to stay with us in
winter rather than migrate to Mexico.
His colors are exquisite, olive-green
bordered by darker tints that throw the
green above and the yellow-tinted white
below into fine relief; a brilliant crown
of reddish-gold, bordered by black and
yellow, and every feather preened to
satiny smoothness. He gleans his food
merrily, singing or calling softly to
himself as he works. His nest is built
in the far northern forests, sometimes
swinging as high as sixty feet, and
woven of pale green mosses, lined with
strips of the silky inside back and
down for the many nestlings.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_COCOA-NUT" id="THE_COCOA-NUT"></a>THE COCOA-NUT.</h2>

<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE fruit of the cocoa-nut palm,
(<i>Cocos nucifera</i>), which is the
most useful tree of all its tribe
to the natives of the regions
in which it grows, is one of the most
valuable and important of commercial
products. On the Malabar and Corvomandel
coasts of India the trees grow
in vast numbers; and in Ceylon, which is
peculiarly well situated for their cultivation,
it is estimated that twenty millions
of the trees flourish. The wealth
of a native in Ceylon is estimated by
his property in cocoa-nut trees, and Sir
Emerson Tennent notes a law case in a
district court in which the subject in
dispute was a claim of the twenty-fifth
twentieth part of an acre of palms. The
tree is very beautiful and lofty, growing
to a height of from sixty to one
hundred feet, with a cylindrical stem
which attains a thickness of two feet.
It terminates in a crown of graceful
leaves. The leaf sometimes attains a
length of twenty feet, consists of a
strong mid-rib, whence numerous long,
acute leaflets spring, giving the whole,
as one traveler described it, the appearance
of a gigantic feather. The fruit
consists of a thick external husk or rind
of a fibrous structure, within which is
the ordinary cocoa-nut of commerce.
The nut has a very hard, woody shell,
inclosing the kernel, within which again
is a milky substance of a rather agreeable
taste.</p>

<p>The cocoa-nut palm is so widely disseminated
throughout tropical countries
that it is impossible to distinguish
its original habitat. It flourishes with
equal vigor on the coast of the East
Indies, throughout the tropical islands
of the Pacific, and in the West Indies
and tropical America. It is most at
home, however, in the numerous small
islands of the Pacific Ocean. Its wide
dissemination is accounted for by the
shape of the fruit, which, dropping into
the sea from trees growing along the
shores, would be carried by the tides
and currents to be cast up and to vegetate
on distant coasts.</p>

<p>The uses to which the various parts
of the cocoa-nut tree are applied in the
regions of their growth are almost endless.
The nuts supply a considerable
proportion of the food of the people,
and the liquor enclosed within them
forms a pleasant and refreshing drink.
The liquid may also be boiled down to
sugar. When distilled it yields a spirit
which is known as "arrack." The trunk
yields a timber which is known in commerce
as porcupine wood, and is used
for building, furniture, and firewood;
the leaves are plaited into fans and
baskets, and for thatching roofs of
houses; the shell of the nut is employed
as a water vessel, and the outer husk or
rind yields the fiber which is used for
the manufacture of ropes, brushes, cordage
and the like. Cocoa-nut-oil is an
important article of commerce. It is
obtained by pressing or boiling the
kernels, which are first broken up into
small pieces and dried in the sun. It is
estimated that one thousand full-sized
nuts will produce upwards of twenty-five
gallons of oil. The oil is a white, solid
substance at ordinary temperature, with
a peculiar rather disagreeable odor. Under
pressure it spreads into a liquid and
a solid, the latter being extensively used
in the manufacture of candles.</p>

<p>Within late years the oil has also
been manufactured into cocoa-nut butter,
retaining, however, in a greater or
less degree a distinct flavor of the nut.</p>

<p>The monkeys and orang-outangs are
very expert in destroying the tough
outer covering of the cocoa-nut, though
quite two inches thick. They insert their
teeth into the tapering end of the nut,
where the shell is very uneven, hold it
firmly with the right foot, and with the
left tear the covering to pieces. Then
thrusting a finger into one of the natural
apertures they pierce a hole, drink
the milk, break the shell on some hard
object and eat the kernel.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BLACK_WALNUT_AND_BUTTERNUT" id="THE_BLACK_WALNUT_AND_BUTTERNUT"></a>
  THE BLACK WALNUT AND BUTTERNUT.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE black walnut (<i>Juglans nigra</i>)
is found in the rich, deep soils,
from western Massachusetts,
west to southern Minnesota
and southward to central Texas and
northern Florida. It is not found
along the gulf or Atlantic coasts to
any extent, but abounds west of the
Allegheny mountains, especially in the
Mississippi Valley. The tree grows
rapidly and to a great size, one specimen
on Long Island having attained a
circumference of twenty-five feet.</p>

<p>The wood is dark-colored, becoming
almost black when properly seasoned,
and was formerly extensively used for
cabinet work, inside finish, gun stocks,
and many ornamental purposes; it is not
in so much demand at present, as other
cheaper woods may be had which seem
to answer the purposes quite as well,
but it is still numbered among our valuable
forest productions.</p>

<p>The nut has a thick, hard shell,
which is deeply and unevenly corrugated
with rough, sharp points and
ridges, and is almost too well known to
admit of description. The kernel is
large and sweet, but has usually a
rather strong, rank taste, less oily than
the butternut. An oil is expressed
from its kernel which is known as nut-oil,
and is much used by painters as a
drying oil. A kind of dye is also manufactured
from the husk, or outside
cover, of the nut.</p>

<p>The butternut, as its name <i>Juglans
cinerea</i> implies, is somewhat related to
the black walnut, in fact, rare instances
are recorded in which the two species
have become mixed, forming a tree
which resembled both species. It is
found in about the same regions frequented
by the black walnut, but extends
further east and north into New
Brunswick, Maine, Quebec, and Ontario,
and does not extend quite so far
west. It is most abundant in the
Ohio River Valley. It is not so
plentiful in the forest as the black
walnut, and where it is so found does
not fruit well. Its favorite resort is
an open grove or along a fence
row. Attempts to cultivate it generally
yield only disappointment, but under
right conditions the trees are very
fruitful, one tree having been known to
produce forty bushels in a single season,
and trees bearing twenty bushels
are frequently reported.</p>

<p>The fruit is longer than that of the
black walnut and tapers to a point at
both ends, with the ridges somewhat
more pronounced, but aside from the
difference in shape they present a similar
appearance.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EDIBLE_PINE" id="THE_EDIBLE_PINE"></a>THE EDIBLE PINE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE edible pine, or piñon (<i>Pinus
edulis</i>), is only one of many varieties
of pine nuts which grows
on the Pacific Slope of the
United States and in Colorado, New
Mexico, Arizona and Mexico.</p>

<p>The pine nut has a rich, marrowy kernel
in a shell that varies in thickness
from that of a chestnut to that of a
hazel-nut. The form and size of the
nuts also vary greatly according to the
species. They are but little known to
the people of the eastern states, but
in some of the cities of California they
are marketed in large quantities. The
larger ones are valued for dessert and
confectionery purposes and will doubtless
become popular in the East.</p>

<p>They are well known to the Indians
and have formed a staple article of
their diet for centuries. Their method
of harvesting them is very simple.
They collect the cones after they have
fallen from the trees, then heat them until
they open, then rattle them out upon
their blankets.</p>

<p>Of the twenty-four species of pine
which grow along the Pacific Slope
one-half furnish seeds that are esteemed
by the Indians as food. When
a Mexican Indian starts out on a long
trip across the country and does not
wish to burden himself with food he
fills a small pouch with piñon nuts and
can subsist on a small number of them
for a remarkably long time.</p>
